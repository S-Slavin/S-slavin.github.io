# Anti-Hallucination AI

A sophisticated iOS/macOS application designed to minimize hallucinations in AI-generated responses through real-time fact-checking and verification.

## Features

- **Real-time Fact Checking**: Verifies AI responses against authoritative sources
- **Confidence Scoring**: Provides transparency about response reliability
- **Source Citations**: Links responses to verified sources
- **Modern SwiftUI Interface**: Clean, intuitive user experience
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on both iOS and macOS

## Technical Implementation

### Core Components

1. **Frontend (SwiftUI)**
   - Modern, responsive UI
   - Real-time input processing
   - Visual confidence indicators
   - Source citation display

2. **Backend Integration**
   - RESTful API communication
   - Real-time fact verification
   - Source validation
   - Response confidence scoring

3. **AI/ML Features**
   - Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
   - Real-time fact-checking
   - Source credibility assessment
   - Confidence scoring algorithms

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Xcode 15.0 or later
- iOS 17.0+ / macOS 14.0+
- Swift 5.9+

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
